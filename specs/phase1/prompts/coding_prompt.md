# Tether -- Coding Session

You are continuing development on Tether, an AI powered finance regulatory compliance monitoring tool. Each session you implement ONE FEATURE ONLY, test it, and leave the codebase in a clean, merge-ready state.

Follow these 10 steps in order. Do not skip any step. Do not do them out of order.

---

## Step 1: Orientation

Get your bearings. Run these commands to understand where you are and what has happened:

```bash
pwd
git log --oneline -20
```

Then read these files:

- `progress.txt` -- session-by-session progress log
- `specs/phase1/feature_list.json` -- the complete feature list with pass/fail status
- `specs/phase1/app_spec.txt` -- the application specification (for reference)

Take note of: which features pass, which don't, what the last session accomplished, and what it recommended as next priorities.

## Step 2: Server Check

The dev server should already be running (started by the loop driver). Verify it:

```bash
curl -sS --connect-timeout 5 -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000/
```

If you get a 200, proceed. If the server is not responding:

```bash
./scripts/dev-up.sh
```

Do NOT run `init.sh` or `npm install` unless you encounter a missing-dependency error during implementation. Do NOT run `npm run dev` directly -- it blocks the session.

## Step 3: Regression Check

Before starting new work, verify that 1-2 features already marked as `passes: true` still work correctly. Pick features relevant to the area you're about to modify.

If you find a regression:

1. Fix it immediately
2. Commit the fix with a descriptive message
3. Note it in your progress entry

Do NOT proceed to new work if existing features are broken.

## Step 4: Feature Selection

Open `specs/phase1/feature_list.json` and find the highest-priority feature where `passes` is `false`. This is the feature you will implement this session.

Rules:

- IMPORTANT: Work on ONLY ONE FEATURE per session!
- Respect priority ordering -- lower priority numbers first
- If a feature depends on another that hasn't passed yet, implement the dependency first
- If you finish early and the feature is verified, you may start the next one

Announce which feature you are working on before writing any code.

## Step 5: Implementation

Write the code needed to make this feature work. Reference `specs/phase1/app_spec.txt` for specifications on models, API routes, scoring rules, etc.

Guidelines:

- Keep changes focused on the selected feature
- Reuse existing utilities in `src/lib/` and `packages/shared/`
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Do not refactor unrelated code
- Do not add features beyond what the feature description specifies

## Step 6: Testing

Test your implementation thoroughly:

IMPORTANT: Chrome is installed and working. Do not skip Playwright testing.
Do not reference previous sessions. The browser MCP tools are
available and functional. Use them when needed for verification.

- **Unit tests**: If the feature involves pure logic (scoring, address normalization, tier enforcement), write or update tests in `__tests__/unit/`
- **Integration tests**: If the feature involves API routes, write or update tests in `__tests__/integration/`
- **Manual verification**: Follow the feature's `verification_steps` exactly. If steps involve UI, and include workds like 'navigate,' use Playwright MCP to:
  1. Navigate to the local server URL to verify each step
  2. Take a screenshot, and save each screenshot as `specs/phase1/screenshots/[task-name].png`

Run the test suite:

```bash
npm test              # Unit + integration tests
```

Do not mark a feature as passing unless ALL verification steps succeed.

## Step 7: Update Feature List

**ONLY after successful verification**, update the feature in `specs/phase1/feature_list.json`:

```json
"passes": true
```

**IT IS UNACCEPTABLE TO:**

- Remove any feature from the list
- Edit the description or verification_steps of any feature
- Reorder features
- Mark a feature as `passes: true` without actually verifying it works

The `passes` field is the ONLY thing you may change, and ONLY from `false` to `true`.

If a feature does not pass verification, leave it as `false` and note the issue in your progress entry. Do not mark partial implementations as passing.

## Step 8: Progress Notes

Append a new session entry to `progress.txt`:

```
## Session N -- [Feature Category]
Date: [today's date]

### Feature Worked On
- [Feature ID]: [Description]
- Status: PASSED / FAILED / PARTIAL

### What Was Done
- [Specific changes made]
- [Files created or modified]

### Testing
- [How the feature was verified]
- [Test results]

### Blockers / Issues
- [Any problems encountered]
- [Workarounds applied]

### Next Priorities
- [Recommended next feature(s) based on dependency order]
- [Any setup or prep needed for next session]
```

## Step 9: Git Commit

AFTER EACH TASK IS COMPLETE: Commit your work with a descriptive message:

```bash
git add <specific files you changed>
git commit -m "feat: <short description of what you implemented>

- Implements feature <ID>: <description>
- <What was tested and how>
- <Any notable implementation decisions>"
```

Rules:

- Stage specific files, not `git add -A`
- Write descriptive commit messages that explain the "why"
- If you need to revert bad changes, use `git checkout -- <file>` or `git revert`
- Make the commit BEFORE updating the progress file (so git log is accurate)

## Step 10: Session Cleanup

Before ending your session, ensure a clean state:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit                   # TypeScript compiles cleanly
git status                          # Working tree is clean (everything committed)
```

Do NOT stop the dev server -- the loop driver manages its lifecycle.

The clean-state principle: leave the codebase in a state where any developer (or agent) could begin work on the next feature without cleaning up your mess first. Code should be merge-ready quality -- no console.logs left in, no commented-out experiments, no half-finished work.

If tsc fails:

1. Fix it
2. Commit the fix
3. Update your progress notes
4. Re-run the check

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS

- ONLY ONE FEATURE per session. Do not try to implement multiple features at once.
- Test BEFORE marking a feature as passing. Premature victory is the most common failure mode.
- If something is broken from a previous session, fix it FIRST.
- Use `git revert` or `git checkout` to undo bad changes rather than trying to manually fix a mess.
- Do NOT modify this prompt file or the initializer prompt.
- Read `specs/phase1/app_spec.txt` when you need details about models, routes, scoring rules, etc.
- When in doubt, commit your work and note the uncertainty in your progress file. A partial, clean commit is better than a broken working tree.
